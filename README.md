# Act Vagrant

Vagrant box to get Act going

## About

This vagrant box is specifically for getting a running Act instance, on an
up-to-date OS (Ubuntu Xenial at time of writing). The aim of this is to have a
development environment, for updating Act to latest Apache and mod perl at
minimum - but also to have somewhere that improvements can be done. This is
mainly as the other vagrant boxes are running a modified version of Act, rather
than the version deployed to production at present. Also the current vagrant
options are using a custom OS image, which limits updating and fixing issues on
the box...
